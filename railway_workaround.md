# 🔧 Railway Unicode Bug Workaround

## 🎯 **The Problem:**
Railway's Prisma system has a Unicode bug that affects deployment tracking.

## 🛠️ **Workaround Strategy:**

### **Method 1: Clean Project Name**
1. Create completely new Railway project with **simple name**:
   - Name: `questionpaper` (no special characters)
   - No emojis, no special characters, no Unicode

### **Method 2: Bypass Prisma Logging**
1. **Environment Variables to Add:**
   ```
   DISABLE_LOGGING = true
   RAILWAY_STATIC_URL = true
   ENVIRONMENT = production
   FORCE_FULL_MODE = true
   ```

### **Method 3: Use Different Repository**
1. Fork your repo with a simple name
2. Deploy from the fork
3. This might avoid the Unicode issue

### **Method 4: Wait and Retry**
Railway's Unicode bug might be temporary. Try:
1. Wait 1-2 hours
2. Create new service
3. Use minimal configuration

## 🧪 **Quick Test:**
```bash
python quick_test.py
```

If you see `{"mode": "full"}`, it's working despite the error!

## 🚨 **If All Railway Methods Fail:**
Switch to **Render.com** - it's more reliable and has no Unicode bugs.
