# Phase 2: Production Deployment with Full Features

## 🎯 **What We're Deploying**

Now that the basic app works, we're adding:
- ✅ **Redis** for background job processing
- ✅ **Full ML capabilities** (smart runtime installation)
- ✅ **Complete API** with upload, generation, search
- ✅ **Auto-scaling architecture**

## 🔄 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Add Redis Service**
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click **"+ New Service"**
3. Select **"Redis"** from templates
4. Redis will auto-configure with internal networking

### **Step 2: Update Main Service**
1. In your backend service settings:
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Add these environment variables:
   ```bash
   REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```

### **Step 3: Deploy Full App**
1. Update `railway.toml` to use production config:
   ```bash
   # Copy railway-production.toml content to railway.toml
   ```

2. Update Docker configuration:
   ```bash
   # Change dockerfilePath in railway.toml:
   "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile.production"
   ```

3. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Phase 2: Add Redis and full ML functionality"
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Step 4: Monitor Deployment**
Watch the deployment logs for:
- ✅ Redis connection established
- ✅ ML dependencies installing in background
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ All endpoints working

## 🚀 **New Features Available**

After deployment, your app will have:

### **Core Endpoints:**
- `GET /` - Main API info
- `GET /health` - Comprehensive health check
- `GET /ping` - Simple connectivity test
- `GET /status` - Detailed system status

### **Document Management:**
- `POST /upload` - Upload PDF textbooks/sample papers
- `GET /documents` - List all uploaded documents
- `DELETE /documents/{doc_id}` - Delete documents

### **Question Generation:**
- `POST /generate` - Generate question papers
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}` - Check generation status
- `GET /download/{filename}` - Download generated PDFs

## 🎛️ **Smart Features**

### **Progressive Loading:**
1. **Immediate startup** - Health checks pass in seconds
2. **Background ML installation** - Happens automatically
3. **Graceful fallbacks** - Clear error messages if not ready
4. **Status tracking** - Real-time feature availability

### **Auto-scaling Architecture:**
- **Database**: SQLite with automatic table creation
- **Redis**: Background job processing
- **ML Models**: Downloaded and cached on first use
- **File Storage**: Persistent uploads and outputs

## 🧪 **Testing Your Deployed App**

```bash
# Test basic connectivity
curl https://your-app-url.railway.app/ping

# Check comprehensive status
curl https://your-app-url.railway.app/status

# Test file upload (after ML is ready)
curl -X POST https://your-app-url.railway.app/upload \
  -F "file=@your-textbook.pdf" \
  -F "doc_type=textbook"

# List documents
curl https://your-app-url.railway.app/documents

# Generate question paper (requires uploaded files)
curl -X POST https://your-app-url.railway.app/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "textbook_ids": ["your-textbook-id"],
    "sample_paper_id": "your-sample-id",
    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "exam_type": "final",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  }'
```

## 🔍 **Monitoring & Debugging**

### **Check System Status:**
```bash
curl https://your-app-url.railway.app/status
```

Response shows:
- Database connectivity
- Redis connection status
- ML processing readiness
- Feature availability

### **Health Check Details:**
```bash
curl https://your-app-url.railway.app/health
```

Shows comprehensive system health including:
- Redis connection
- Database status
- ML model status
- Component readiness

### **If Something Goes Wrong:**

1. **Check Railway logs** in the dashboard
2. **Monitor resource usage** (CPU, Memory)
3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
4. **Test individual components** using status endpoints

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Health check returns `"status": "healthy"`
- ✅ Status shows all features as `true`
- ✅ File upload works without errors
- ✅ Redis shows as `"connected"`
- ✅ ML status shows as `"ready"`

## 🔧 **Quick Fixes**

### **ML Not Ready:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for background installation
- Check logs for installation progress
- ML models are ~2GB and need time to download

### **Redis Not Connected:**
- Verify `REDIS_URL` environment variable is set
- Check Redis service is running in Railway
- Restart backend service if needed

### **Upload Errors:**
- Ensure data directories are created
- Check file permissions
- Verify ML dependencies are ready

## 🎯 **Next Phase: Frontend Integration**

Once the backend is stable:
1. Deploy React frontend as separate service
2. Configure CORS and API endpoints
3. Set up domain and SSL
4. Add monitoring and analytics
